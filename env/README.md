# Context

All the app’s env variable's will be described here.

## Contents

- This folder consist two env files.
  1. .env.example : This file is used to describe the structure of .env file and will be given the dynamic values during the CI/CD .
  2. .env.local : This file is used to describe the structure of .env file for development environment.

> **Note:** To prevent accidentally leaking env variables to the client, only variables prefixed with VITE\_ are exposed to your Vite-processed code. e.g. for the following env variables:

```js
VITE_SOME_KEY = 123;
DB_PASSWORD = foobar;
```

> Only VITE_SOME_KEY will be exposed as import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY to your client source code, but DB_PASSWORD will not.

```js
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY); // 123
console.log(import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD); // undefined
```

Please visit [Vite Docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files) for more details.
