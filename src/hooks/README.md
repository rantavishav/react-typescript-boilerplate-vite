# Constants

Here we can place files related to custom hooks.

## Contents

- This folder consist where all the reusable custom hooks for your application are stored.

> **Note:** It's recommended to have an `index.ts` file that exports all of the files in that folder. This is to make it easier to import files from the folder.

## File Naming Convention

- Folder and file name should be in camelCase.
- File name should be prefixed with the 'use' word (e.g useLocalStorage).
- Try to create named-exports instead of default exports for all the configs. This will avoid any naming conflicts.

## Usage

To use an config, import it from the folder's `index.ts` file.

## Props

This folder has no props.

## Setup

This folder has no additional setup required.

## Dependencies
